## Recommendation

Before deleting any files, please verify that:
1. The files are indeed unused in the application
2. You have backups of important documentation
3. Team members are not actively working on any of these files

The following files are recommended for deletion first as they are clearly redundant:
- All enhanced_* files
- All ultra_premium_* files  
- All elite_premium_* files
- The enhanced dashboard files in admin/ and customer/ directories
