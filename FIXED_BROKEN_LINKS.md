# Fixed Broken Links Report

## Summary
This document tracks all the broken links that have been fixed in the JobsMtaani platform. Previously, several PHP files were referenced in the codebase but did not exist, causing 404 errors when users clicked on navigation links.

## Fixed Links

### 1. Service Details Page
**Issue**: `service-details.php` was referenced in [index.php](file:///C:/Users/LENOVO/Music/xampp-server/htdocs/jobsmtaani/index.php) and [services.php](file:///C:/Users/LENOVO/Music/xampp-server/htdocs/jobsmtaani/services.php) but did not exist.
**Solution**: Created [service-details.php](file:///C:/Users/LENOVO/Music/xampp-server/htdocs/jobsmtaani/service-details.php) with complete service details functionality.
**Files Affected**: 
- [index.php](file:///C:/Users/LENOVO/Music/xampp-server/htdocs/jobsmtaani/index.php) (line 149)
- [services.php](file:///C:/Users/LENOVO/Music/xampp-server/htdocs/jobsmtaani/services.php) (line 159)

### 2. Customer Dashboard Pages
**Issue**: Several customer dashboard pages were referenced in navigation but did not exist.
**Solution**: Created the following customer pages:
- [customer/bookings.php](file:///C:/Users/LENOVO/Music/xampp-server/htdocs/jobsmtaani/customer/bookings.php) - View and manage bookings
- [customer/favorites.php](file:///C:/Users/LENOVO/Music/xampp-server/htdocs/jobsmtaani/customer/favorites.php) - View favorite services
- [customer/reviews.php](file:///C:/Users/LENOVO/Music/xampp-server/htdocs/jobsmtaani/customer/reviews.php) - Leave and view reviews

**Files Affected**:
- [customer/index.php](file:///C:/Users/LENOVO/Music/xampp-server/htdocs/jobsmtaani/customer/index.php) (navigation links)

### 3. Remaining Dashboard Pages (To Be Implemented)
The following dashboard pages are still referenced but not yet created:
- Admin: users.php, services.php, bookings.php, categories.php, reviews.php, settings.php, reports.php, permissions.php
- Provider: services.php, bookings.php, earnings.php, reviews.php, profile.php

## Verification
All created files have been tested and are functional:
- ✅ [service-details.php](file:///C:/Users/LENOVO/Music/xampp-server/htdocs/jobsmtaani/service-details.php) - Displays detailed service information
- ✅ [customer/bookings.php](file:///C:/Users/LENOVO/Music/xampp-server/htdocs/jobsmtaani/customer/bookings.php) - Shows customer bookings
- ✅ [customer/favorites.php](file:///C:/Users/LENOVO/Music/xampp-server/htdocs/jobsmtaani/customer/favorites.php) - Shows favorite services
- ✅ [customer/reviews.php](file:///C:/Users/LENOVO/Music/xampp-server/htdocs/jobsmtaani/customer/reviews.php) - Manages customer reviews

## Testing Instructions
1. Visit `http://localhost/jobsmtaani/service-details.php?id=1` to test the service details page
