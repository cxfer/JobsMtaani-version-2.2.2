# Improved Footer Visibility and Subscription Categories

## Summary
This document tracks the improvements made to enhance footer visibility and add subscription-based categories to the JobsMtaani platform.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Footer Visibility
**Issue**: Text in the footer was not clearly visible against the dark background.
**Solution**: Updated the footer styling in `includes/unified_footer.php` to:
- Change text color from `text-muted` to `text-light` for better contrast
- Add `text-white` class to headings for improved readability
- Maintain consistent styling while ensuring all text is clearly visible

### 2. Added Subscription-Based Categories
**Issue**: The platform lacked premium subscription-based service categories.
**Solution**: 
- Added `is_premium` column to the `service_categories` table
- Created 5 new premium categories:
  1. Premium Home Services
  2. Luxury Beauty & Wellness
  3. Executive Transportation
  4. Professional Consultation
  5. Elite Events & Catering
- Updated the Service class to handle premium categories
- Modified category display on both index.php and services.php to show premium indicators

### 3. Created Subscription Plans Page
**Issue**: No dedicated page to showcase premium subscription options.
**Solution**: Created `subscription-plans.php` featuring:
- Premium membership pricing and benefits
- Visual display of premium service categories
- FAQ section for common subscription questions
- Responsive design with professional styling
