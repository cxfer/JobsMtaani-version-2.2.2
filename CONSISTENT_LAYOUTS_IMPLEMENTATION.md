This document outlines the implementation of consistent layouts across all JobsMtaani pages, including frontend pages and dashboards. The goal was to create a unified user experience with consistent navigation, styling, and layout patterns throughout the application.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Unified Header and Footer System

### 2. Frontend Pages Updated

All main frontend pages now use the unified header and footer:

- `contact.php` (Contact page)

#### Improvements:
- Consistent typography and color scheme
