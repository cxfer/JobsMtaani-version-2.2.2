# Registration and Login Flow Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the registration and login flows with onboarding and Google sign-in functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Registration Flow (register.php)
- After successful registration with email/password, users are now redirected to the onboarding page
- Session variables are set to track the pending user ID and type
- Users must complete onboarding before accessing their dashboard

### 2. Onboarding Flow (onboarding.php)
- Handles both social login users and regular registration users
- Collects additional user details including:
  - Phone number
  - Address
  - City
  - National ID number
  - National ID document upload
- After completion, users are authenticated and redirected to their respective dashboards

### 3. Login Flow (login.php)
- Enhanced Google sign-in to directly authenticate users and redirect to dashboards
- Other social login providers still require onboarding if user details are incomplete
- Regular email/password login works as before

## User Flow

### Email/Password Registration
1. User fills registration form
2. Account is created with "pending" status
3. User is redirected to onboarding page
4. User completes onboarding form with ID details
5. User is authenticated and redirected to dashboard

### Google Sign-In
1. User clicks Google sign-in button
2. User authenticates with Google
3. User is directly authenticated and redirected to dashboard
4. No onboarding required for Google sign-in

### Other Social Login (Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo)
1. User clicks social login button
2. User authenticates with provider
3. If user details are incomplete, redirected to onboarding
4. User completes onboarding form
5. User is authenticated and redirected to dashboard

### Email/Password Login
1. User enters credentials
2. If valid, user is authenticated and redirected to dashboard
3. If invalid, error message is displayed

## Security Considerations
- Passwords are securely hashed using PHP's password_hash function
- File uploads are validated for type and size
- Session management follows best practices
- SQL injection prevention using prepared statements
