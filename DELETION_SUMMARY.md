## Rationale

These files were deleted because:
1. They were older versions of pages that have been superseded by newer implementations
2. They were redundant copies of functionality
3. They were documentation files that are no longer relevant
4. They were unused configuration files related to frameworks not being used

## Remaining Files

The following types of files were kept:
1. Current implementation files (index.php, services.php, about.php, contact.php)
2. Ultimate premium versions of key pages
3. Dashboard files for admin, customer, and provider
4. Essential configuration and class files
5. Important documentation files
6. Asset files (CSS, JS, images)

## Benefits

By removing these unused files, we have:
- Reduced project clutter
- Eliminated confusion about which files are current
- Reduced storage space usage
- Simplified the project structure
- Made it easier to maintain and navigate the codebase
