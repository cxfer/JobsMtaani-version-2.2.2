3. Access `login.php` to test authentication
4. Navigate to role-specific dashboards:
   - Customer: `customer/index.php`
   - Provider: `provider/index.php`
   - Admin: `admin/index.php`
5. Run `test_all_features.php` for automated feature verification

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: PHP 8.2
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0
- **Frontend**: Pure PHP with Bootstrap 5
- **Authentication**: Session-based with password hashing
- **Dependencies**: Only essential Node.js packages for build scripts

## Conclusion
The JobsMtaani platform is a fully functional, purely PHP-based application with all requested features implemented and working correctly. The redundant frontend files have been successfully removed, and the application is ready for production use.
